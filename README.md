## Story and Map Description
This tale tells the story of a young man who sails out to sea in search of unknown lands, adventures, and treasure. In his small boat, Ron finally sees land after drifting on water for three days and three nights. As he stared out at the island, he could see no more than a small beach with a few trees and a mountain. Once he had anchored his boat on the beach, Ron was eager to begin exploring, so he immediately headed in the direction of the mountain. While he was on his way, he stumbled upon an underground cave. Unlike natural caves, this one was carved by someone. Since Ron is an experienced treasure hunter and explorer, he enters the cave without fear. Upon entering the cave, Ron finds a torch. As soon as he lit it, the cave entrance closed. A written message was displayed on the wall in front of him.

"The only way out of this dungeon is to defeat the evil with the key that is in The Throne Room. To accomplish this you first must uncover the dungeon secrets and collect all 7 items that will help you defeat the Evil Wizard. The items are, the amethyst belt in the Amethyst Shrine, the diamond body armor in the Diamond Library, the ruby boots in the Ruby Depository, the sapphire helm in the Sapphire Foyer, the emerald shield in the Emerald Laboratory, the rubellite amulet in the Rubellite Observatory, the magic sword in the Music Hall. After you have gathered all of these items, proceed directly to the Throne Room where you will find the Evil Wizard."

Pseudocode:
The pseudocode explains how the player moves between rooms and collects items. Black color font is used to write the code logic responsible for moving and updating the player's location. A <span style="color:blue">blue color font</span> was used for all of the code logic that describes how the player will collect items. The pseudocode consists of two main FUNCTIONS, one for changing the location of the player and one for collecting items. All game functions will run inside a WHILE LOOP. Certain conditions will be used to break the loop if the player wins or loses.
